# sets

This package handles fetching set data from Smogon and third party sources as well as
weighting information from usage statistics for use by the Pok√©mon Showdown damage
calculator UI. While the top level package houses UI and view logic, this sub package
contains code which runs on the server as part of the build process.

This package is also distributed under the terms of the [MIT License][1].
